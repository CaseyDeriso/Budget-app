BUDGETY. 

Budgety is my first completed project in vanilla JavaScript. It was built along side a course I took on JavaScript by Jonas Schmedtmann. 

Functionality that I have added beyond base project in lecture:
1. I added date to each list item. 

Functionality that I wish to add in the future:
1. I want to be able to store budget data after refresh to make the took workable in the real world. 
2. I want to be able to add profiles that can be logged into to store who's budget is displayed. 
2. I want to be able to have a shared budget for couples or friends that can show different users incomes and expenses in one budget. 

The budgetController.testing prototype will log the object which holds all of the list items in the budget.
