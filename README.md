# BUDGETY. 


Budgety is my first completed project in vanilla JavaScript. I was walked through the javascript line by line, it started as a completed HTML and CSS page that the course "Javascript master course" by Jonas Schmedtmann provided. 

### Functionality that I have added beyond base project in lecture:

-  I added date to each list item. 

### Functionality that I wish to add in the future:

- I want to be able to store budget data after refresh to make the took workable in the real world. 
- I want to be able to add profiles that can be logged into to store who's budget is displayed. 
- I want to be able to have a shared budget for couples or friends that can show different users incomes and expenses in one budget. 

**The budgetController.testing prototype will log the object which holds all of the list items in the budget.**
